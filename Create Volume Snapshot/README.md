# Create Volume Snapshot

## 🎯 Objective

The DevOps team needs to automate backups for important EBS volumes. As part of these efforts, a snapshot must be created manually from an existing volume named `datacenter-vol` in the `us-east-1` region.

The requirements are:

Create a snapshot of the volume `datacenter-vol`, name it `datacenter-vol-ss`, set the description to `datacenter Snapshot`, and ensure the snapshot status reaches `completed`.

This snapshot will serve as a backup image for data recovery or future volume creation.
