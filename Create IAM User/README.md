# Create IAM User

## 🎯 Objective

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a core AWS service used to manage users and control access to AWS resources. As part of the onboarding and configuration process, the DevOps team must create IAM users for controlled access.

The objective of this task is:

Create an IAM user named `iamuser_mark` in the AWS account (us-east-1).

No additional requirements such as permissions, groups, or login access were mentioned, so only the user creation is needed.
