# Attach Elastic IP to EC2 Instance

## 🎯 Objective

The Nautilus DevOps team is working on improving AWS cloud resource management as part of their migration strategy. An EC2 instance named `datacenter-ec2` and an Elastic IP named `datacenter-ec2-eip` already exist in the `us-east-1` region.

The objective of this task is to:

Attach the Elastic IP `datacenter-ec2-eip` to the EC2 instance `datacenter-ec2` in the `us-east-1` region.

This ensures that the EC2 instance has a persistent public IP that remains the same even when the instance is stopped and started.
