# Terminate EC2 Instance

## 🎯 Objective

During the migration process, certain EC2 instances were identified as obsolete because newer solutions were implemented. An EC2 instance named `nautilus-ec2` in the `us-east-1` region is no longer required and must be removed.

The objective of this task is to:

Terminate the EC2 instance named `nautilus-ec2` and ensure its final state is `terminated`.

This helps keep the environment clean and prevents unnecessary billing.
