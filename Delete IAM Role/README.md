# Delete IAM Role

## 🎯 Objective

During the cleanup phase of the AWS migration process, the DevOps team identified IAM roles that were created for one-time use and are no longer required. One such role is `iamrole_javed`, which must be deleted to maintain a clean and secure IAM environment.

The objective of this task is:

Delete the IAM role named `iamrole_javed` in the `us-east-1` region.

Cleanup ensures unused roles do not present security or operational risks.
