# Create Subnet

## 🎯 Objective of the Task

Create a subnet named `devops-subnet` under the default VPC in the `us-east-1` region.

The subnet must:
- Belong to the default VPC
- Have the Name tag = `devops-subnet`
- Be created in `us-east-1`
- Use a valid CIDR block (for example: 10.0.1.0/24)

The task does not specify a CIDR block, so we choose a standard one that fits inside the default VPC's range.
