⚠️ IMPORTANT BEFORE DELETION

AWS does not allow deleting a role if:

It is being used by a service

So follow these checks:

A) Detach Any Policies

In the role details page, go to the Permissions tab

For each attached policy → click:

Detach policy

B) Remove Instance Profile (if present)

If you see an “Instance profile” listed:

Go to the Trust relationships or Role usage section

Remove the instance profile by clicking Remove

(If none exist, skip this step.)

✅ STEP 5 — Delete the Role

Once the role has no policies and no instance profile:

At the top-right, click:

Delete


Confirm the deletion in the popup.

📝 STEP 6 — Verify Deletion

Go back to:

IAM → Roles


Search for:

iamrole_javed


It should no longer appear in the list.
