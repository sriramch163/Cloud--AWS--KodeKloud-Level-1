# Create Private S3 Bucket via AWS CLI

## 🎯 Objective of the Task

The objective is to create an Amazon S3 bucket using AWS CLI with the following requirements:

- **Bucket name:** xfusion-s3-14087
- The bucket must block all public access → meaning it must be completely private.
- All operations must be performed in the `us-east-1` region.
- You must use the aws-client terminal because AWS console access is disabled.

This ensures secure data storage while adhering to migration and compliance requirements.
