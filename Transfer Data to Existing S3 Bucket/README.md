# Transfer Data to Existing S3 Bucket

## 🎯 Objective

As part of the data migration efforts, the DevOps team must transfer files from on-premises systems to AWS S3 buckets. An S3 bucket named `datacenter-cp-12657` already exists and needs to be populated with provided data.

The goal of this task is:

Copy the file `/tmp/datacenter.txt` from the AWS client machine to the S3 bucket `datacenter-cp-12657` in the `us-east-1` region.

This ensures the migrated data is stored securely in AWS S3.
