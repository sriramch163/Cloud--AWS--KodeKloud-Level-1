## 🎯 Objective

As part of the data migration process, several S3 buckets must be created for storing different types of data. One requirement is to create a public S3 bucket that allows external visibility or access depending on later configurations.

The goal of this task is:

Create a public S3 bucket named `nautilus-s3-22272` in the `us-east-1` region.
This bucket must allow public access, unlike the private buckets created earlier.
