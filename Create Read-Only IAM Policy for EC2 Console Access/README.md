# Create Read-Only IAM Policy for EC2 Console Access

## 🎯 Objective

IAM policies define permissions that control access to AWS services. As part of IAM configuration, the DevOps team must create a policy that provides read-only access to EC2 resources.

The goal of this task is:

Create an IAM policy named `iampolicy_javed` in the `us-east-1` region, allowing users read-only access to EC2, including viewing Instances, AMIs, and Snapshots in the EC2 console.

This ensures that users can view EC2 resources but cannot modify, create, or delete anything.
