# Delete EC2 Instance via AWS CLI

## 🎯 Objective of the Task

The objective is to delete an unused EC2 instance that is no longer required in the environment.
Console access is restricted, so you must perform the deletion entirely using the AWS CLI from the aws-client host.

You must:

- Identify and delete the EC2 instance named `nautilus-ec2` in the `us-east-1` region.
- Confirm that the instance reaches the `terminated` state before submitting the task.
