## 🎯 Objective

During their migration to AWS, the Nautilus DevOps team is creating multiple S3 buckets for structured data storage. One such bucket must be private and disallow all forms of public access.

The goal of this task is:

Create an S3 bucket named `xfusion-s3-26630` in the `us-east-1` region and block all public access to ensure the bucket remains private.

This ensures secure, internal-only storage of sensitive migration data.
