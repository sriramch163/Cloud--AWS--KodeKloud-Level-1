# Attach IAM Policy to IAM User

## 🎯 Objective

IAM users require permissions to access AWS resources, and these permissions are granted through IAM policies. In this task, both the IAM user `iamuser_john` and the IAM policy `iampolicy_john` already exist in the AWS account.

The objective is:

Attach the IAM policy `iampolicy_john` to the IAM user `iamuser_john` in the `us-east-1` region.

This allows the user to inherit the permissions defined in the policy.
