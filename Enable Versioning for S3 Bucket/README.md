# Enable Versioning for S3 Bucket

## 🎯 Objective

To improve data protection and recovery in the AWS environment, the DevOps team must ensure that accidental deletions or overwrites can be recovered. S3 Versioning is a core AWS feature that preserves, retrieves, and restores previous versions of objects.

The goal of this task is:

Enable Versioning on the S3 bucket named `nautilus-s3-23994` in the `us-east-1` region.

Enabling versioning protects data stored in the bucket during migrations and ongoing operations.
