# Attach Elastic Network Interface to EC2 Instance

## 🎯 Objective

As part of the cloud migration efforts, an EC2 instance named `datacenter-ec2` and an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) named `datacenter-eni` already exist in the `us-east-1` region.

The objective of this task is to:

Attach the network interface `datacenter-eni` to the EC2 instance `datacenter-ec2` and ensure its status becomes `attached`.

This allows the instance to have an additional network interface for improved connectivity or segmentation.
