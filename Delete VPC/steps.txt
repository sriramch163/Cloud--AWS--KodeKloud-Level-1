Steps to Delete the VPC Using AWS Console

Perform the steps carefully, as VPC deletion has dependencies.

Step 1: Log in to AWS Console

Open the provided Console URL.

Enter the username and password.

Confirm the region is set to:
N. Virginia (us-east-1).

Step 2: Navigate to the VPC Dashboard

In the AWS search bar, type VPC.

Select VPC from the services list.

Step 3: Identify the VPC

Click Your VPCs from the left panel.

Locate the VPC named:
datacenter-vpc.

Note the VPC ID, as it will help identify associated components.

Before You Can Delete the VPC: Remove All Dependencies

AWS will not permit deleting a VPC unless the following items are deleted or detached.

Follow these sub-steps in order.

Step 4: Delete Subnets

On the left menu, click Subnets.

Filter using the VPC ID from datacenter-vpc.

Select each subnet associated with this VPC.

Click Actions → Delete subnet.

Step 5: Detach and Delete the Internet Gateway

On the left panel, select Internet gateways.

Locate any IGW attached to this VPC.

Select it → Actions → Detach from VPC.

Then delete it → Actions → Delete internet gateway.

Step 6: Delete Route Tables

On the left, select Route tables.

Filter by the VPC ID.

You cannot delete the main route table, but delete all custom ones:

Select route table → Actions → Delete route table.

(Main route table will be deleted automatically when VPC is deleted.)

Step 7: Delete Security Groups

Select Security groups in the left menu.

Filter by the VPC ID.

Delete any security group except the default one.

The default security group will be removed automatically on VPC deletion.

Step 8: Delete Network ACLs (if any custom ones exist)

Select Network ACLs.

Filter by VPC ID.

Delete any custom NACLs.

(Default NACL is removed automatically with the VPC.)

Step 9: Delete any Additional Attached Resources

Only apply if they exist:

NAT Gateways
(Delete them; wait for status to become “Deleted.”)

Elastic IPs
(Release them)

Endpoints
(Delete them)

Finally: Delete the VPC
Step 10: Delete datacenter-vpc

Go to Your VPCs.

Select the VPC named datacenter-vpc.
